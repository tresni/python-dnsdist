# python-dnsdist
Python library to talk to [dnsdist](http://dnsdist.org)

Since version 1.2.0, dnsdist uses merged nonces to send and receive messages, while pre 1.2.0 dnsdist does not.

The default is to use the pre-1.2.0 behaviour. To enable, set the merge\_nonces argument to True.

## Requirements

* [libnacl](https://libnacl.readthedocs.org/) is required if you need to talk to a dnsdist instance that is compiled with libsodium support

  ```
  pip install libnacl
  ```

## Example
```python
from DNSDist import Console

# Connect to dnsdist on localhost:5199 without a key
console = Console()
print console.execute('showServers()')
```

```python
from DNSDist import Console

# Connect to dnsdist 1.2.0+ instance on 10.100.1.2:3200 with supplied key
console = Console(key='tZ+bElqKb+moWK1BAAlSjIjAdVb9zTXT7Ziqj/lw/R8=', host='10.100.1.2', port=3200, merge_nonces=True)
print console.execute('showServers()')
```

```python
from DNSDist import Console

# Connect to dnsdist pre 1.2.0 instance on 10.100.1.2:3200 with supplied key
console = Console(key='tZ+bElqKb+moWK1BAAlSjIjAdVb9zTXT7Ziqj/lw/R8=', host='10.100.1.2', port=3200)
print console.execute('showServers()')
```

```python
from DNSDist import Console

# Connect to dnsdist instance on 10.100.1.2 and do not use libsodium even if its available
console = Console(host='10.100.1.2', have_sodium=False)
print console.execute('showServers()')
```
